The name of our game is "Treasure". The objective of our game is to help peppa found the treasure. She need collect enough apples to get treasure and won the game. Some obstacles that peppa need to face is the tree branch and the speed of the apple past by. Make sure that peppa don't touch the tree branch. If she did, the game will be over. However, if the player collided 15 apples, then you win! (Use the arrow key to help you move around, and use space bar to jump.)
